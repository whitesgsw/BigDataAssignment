Grp7_0306_OutLReg.ipynb brings together removal of outliers by Sean and the regression code from Lin, it runs but in a sample of 3000 rows we have no predictions, the outliers function may be removing to many features. ???? 
I added in GRP7_2Boxplot so that this can be added back to the phase 2 notebook, only because we said we would.
